Vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle and AWD provided a non random-amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset
The slope of the linear is not considered zero. This is due to the fact that the p-value is 5.35e-11, which is lower than the significance level of 0.05
The multiple R squared amount is 0.7149 which tells us that 71.49% of the time, the model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively

The current manufacturing data meets the design specification for all manufacturing lots in total. The variance is 62.29356 which is under 100

The manufacturing data meets the design specification for lots 1 and 2. The variances are well below 100 these lots. However, the Lot3 does not meet the specification and has a variance of 170.286 which is well above 100
